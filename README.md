# Malware Classification

For this project, we are using the data from the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge,
which consists of nearly half a terabyte of uncompressed data. There are no fewer
than 9 classes of malware, but unlike the documents from P1, each instance of malware
has one, and only one, of the following family categories:

1. Ramnit
2. Lollipop
3. Kelihos_ver3
4. Vundo
5. Simda
6. Tracur
7. Kelihos_ver1
8. Obfuscator.ACY
9. Gatak

## Getting Started
